# JS Tasks

## about string, number, arrays

## dont use any built-in functions

1. Write program that will reverse string: `'Hello world' => 'dlrow olleH'`

2. Write program to repeat every character in string 3 times: `'Hello world' => 'HHHeeellllllooo wwwooorrrlllddd!!!'`

3. Write program to repeat given string n times: `'Hello world', 3 => 'Hello worldHello worldHello world'`

4. Write program to find the first not repeated character: `'abacddbec' => 'e'`

5. Write program to find the first repeated character: `'abacddbec' => 'a'`

6. Write program to find the count of each character: `'abacddbec' => {a: 2, b: 2, c: 1, d: 3, e: 1}`

7. Write program that truncates string in a given length: `'Hello world', 5 => 'Hello...'`

8. Write program that truncates string in a given length, but it should not break the word: `'Hello world, nice talking to you', 20 => 'Hello world, nice...'`

9. Create a program to calculate the sum of the elements in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15`

10. Create a program to calculate the average of the elements in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 3`

11. Create a program to find the maximum number in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 5`

12. Create a program to find the minimum number in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 1`

13. Create a program to find the second largest number in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 4`

14. Create a program to find the second smallest number in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 2`

15. Create a program to find the count of each element in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2}`

16. Create a program to find the sum of the odd numbers in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 9`

17. Create a program to find the sum of the even numbers in an array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 6`
